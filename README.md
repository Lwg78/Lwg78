## 📂 Portfolio Projects

### 🛒 Retail Operations & Supply Chain AI
*My core focus: Bringing engineering rigor to supermarket logistics.*

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[FreshGuard V2 (Retail Waste)](https://github.com/Lwg78/retail-waste-management-v2)** | **🚀 Flagship.** Production-grade forecasting engine reducing perishable waste. Features **Docker**, **CI/CD**, and **Streamlit**. *The engineered evolution of V1.* | Python, Docker, Pytest, Holt-Winters |
| **[Stocktake Variance Reporter](https://github.com/Lwg78/Stocktake-Variance-Reporter)** | **Automation Tool.** A full-stack utility designed to cut stocktake reporting time by 99%. Includes "Theft Detection" logic and a web UI. | FastAPI, Docker, Pandas |
| **[Enterprise Retail Solution](https://github.com/Lwg78/Enterprise-Solution-for-Supermarket-style-retail)** | **Advanced R&D.** A predictive analytics experiment utilizing **Armstrong Cycle Transformers** to forecast complex sales demand patterns. | Time-Series, PyTorch Transformers |
| **[Retail Waste System (V1)](https://github.com/Lwg78/retail-waste-management-system)** | **Prototype.** My initial menu-driven application for inventory tracking. Focuses on core CRUD operations and basic analytics. | Python, Matplotlib, Pandas |

### 🧠 AI Engineering & Search Systems
*Building efficient, modular systems for real-world constraints.*

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Silver Retriever](https://github.com/Lwg78/Silver-Retriever)** | **Offline RAG System.** A modular search engine designed for legacy hardware (No GPUs). Features a **Plugin Architecture** ("The Brain") to detect user intent (Deadlines, Tasks) using TF-IDF instead of heavy LLMs. Includes **CI/CD** and **Smart Chunking**. | Python, Streamlit, Scikit-Learn, GitHub Actions |

### 🧬 Bio-Informatics & Deep Learning
*Applying AI to decode complex genomic sequences.*

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Genomic Decoder V2](https://github.com/Lwg78/genomic-decoder-v2)** | **Advanced Pipeline.** Refined Deep Learning architecture for DNA sequencing. Focuses on modular code structure and improved inference performance over the original. | PyTorch, BioPython, CI/CD |
| **[Genomic Decoder (FlyOS)](https://github.com/Lwg78/genomic-decoder-fly)** | **Research Implementation.** An end-to-end pipeline that reads raw DNA sequences to predict gene expression. Features **O(1) lazy-loading** for massive datasets. | PyTorch, Transformers |

### 🎓 Early Projects
| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[O-Level Predictor](https://github.com/Lwg78/O-Level-Predictor)** | **First App.** My very first attempt to convert a Python calculation script into an interactive web app using Streamlit. | Python, Streamlit |
