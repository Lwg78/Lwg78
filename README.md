### 🚀 Portfolio Projects

| Project | Domain | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Genomic Decoder (FlyOS)](https://github.com/Lwg78/genomic-decoder-fly)** | 🧬 **Bio-AI** | `PyTorch` `Transformers` `Biopython` |
| *An end-to-end Deep Learning pipeline that reads raw DNA sequences and predicts gene expression. Features O(1) lazy-loading for massive datasets and automated reproducibility pipelines.* | | |
| **[Stocktake Variance Reporter](https://github.com/Lwg78/Stocktake-Variance-Reporter)** | 🛍️ **Retail Ops** | `FastAPI` `Docker` `Pandas` |
| *A full-stack automation tool designed to cut stocktake reporting time by 99%. Includes a Web Interface for Store Managers and automated "Theft Detection" logic.* | | |
| **[Retail Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/Lwg78/Enterprise-Solution-for-Supermarket-style-retail)** | 📈 **Data Science** | `Time-Series` `Transformer` |
| *A predictive analytics model designed for supermarket-style retail, utilizing Armstrong Cycle Transformers to forecast sales demand.* | | |

*(Note: My O-Level-Predictor is the first attempt to launch a simple python script into streamlit app.)*
